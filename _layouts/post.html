          <br><br>The purpose of this pre-giveaway competition is to measure the public's interest in winning {{ page.product_name | escape }} (hence the Promotion Name "I WANT..."). Once it is clear that there is a significant number of people wanting to win {{ page.product_name | escape }} free for a year, then EPIC WIN will present our competition statistics to {{ page.product_name | escape }} with the goal of convincing them to sponsor future giveaways that will award an Annual Subscription as a prize.
          <br><br>If {{ page.product_name | escape }} agrees to sponsor future giveaways, then EPIC WIN will also attempt to convince {{ page.product_name | escape }} to give an Annual Subscription as a gift to the winner of this competition to thank them for leading the way for other future winners (but please note that this gift is outside the scope of this competition and {{ page.product_name | escape }} is absolutely under no circumstances obliged to give this gift, or any other gift, to the competition winner).
          <br><br>It’s worth mentioning that if an entrant has the skill to win this pre-giveaway competition then they will also be well suited to win a sponsored giveaway if/when one becomes available in the future.
          <br><br>Every entry into an EPIC WIN pre-giveaway competition matters; these entries will really help to convince companies (like {{ page.product_name | escape }}) that a platform where entrepreneurs can win software for their startups is a valuable idea worthy of their sponsorship.

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Errors and omissions may be accepted at the Promoter's discretion. Failure by the Promoter to enforce any of its rights at any stage does not constitute a waiver of those rights. The Promoter's legal rights to recover damages or other compensation from such an offender are reserved.</li>
      <li>Entrants must comply with the Verification Requirements. The Promoter may require entrants to provide these to the Promoter or its agent as part of the entry verification or prize claim process.

      <li>All entries will be the property of the Promoter and will not be returned.</li>
      <li>The Prize is not transferable or exchangeable and, except for cash prizes, cannot be redeemed for cash or any other form of compensation.

      <li>If for any reason any aspect of this Promotion does not or is not capable of running as planned, including by reason of infection by computer virus, network failure, bugs, tampering, unauthorised intervention, fraud, technical failures or any cause beyond the control of the Promoter which corrupts or affects the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of this Promotion, the Promoter may in its sole discretion cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Promotion, or invalidate any affected entries. </li>
      <li>The Promoter’s decisions in connection with the Promotion are final and no correspondence will be entered into.</li>
      <li>Nothing in these Conditions of Entry limits, excludes or modifies or purports to limit, exclude or modify the statutory consumer guarantees as provided under the Competition and Consumer Act, as well as any other implied warranties under the ASIC Act or similar consumer protection laws in the States and Territories of Australia (“Non-Excludable Guarantees”). Except for any liability that cannot by law be excluded, including the Non-Excludable Guarantees, the Promoter (including its respective officers, employees and agents) excludes all liability (including negligence), for any personal injury; or any loss or damage (including loss of opportunity); whether direct, indirect, special or consequential, arising in any way out of the promotion.</li>
      <li>Except for any liability that cannot by law be excluded, including the Non-Excludable Guarantees, the Promoter (including its respective officers, employees and agents) is not responsible for and excludes all liability (including negligence), for any personal injury; or any loss or damage (including loss of opportunity); whether direct, indirect, special or consequential, arising in any way out of: (a) any technical difficulties or equipment malfunction (whether or not under the Promoter’s control); (b) any theft, unauthorised access or third party interference; (c) any entry or prize claim that is late, lost, altered, damaged or misdirected (whether or not after their receipt by the Promoter) due to any reason beyond the reasonable control of the Promoter; (d) any variation in prize value to that stated in these Conditions of Entry; (e) any tax liability incurred by a winner or entrant; or (f) use of the prize.</li>
      <li>The Promoter may at its absolute discretion prohibit an entrant’s participation in this Promotion, cancel or suspend a prize or other cease to provide any prize to a winner if the entrant or winner is (in the Promoter’s opinion) under the influence of alcohol or drugs, behaves aggressively or disruptively, or behaves in a manner which may diminish the good name and reputation of the Promoter or its products and brands, or is contrary to law or is otherwise inappropriate.</li>
      <li>The Promoter accepts no responsibility for any tax implications that may arise from the prize winnings. Independent financial advice should be sought. Where the operation of this Promotion results in, for GST purposes, supplies being made for non-monetary consideration, entrants agree to follow the Australian Taxation Office’s stated view that where the parties are at arm’s length, goods and services exchanged are of equal GST inclusive market values.</li>

Entry is conditional on providing this PI. The Promoter will also use and handle PI as set out in its Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at https://epicwin.io/privacy.
